### Hi There <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">, I'm Iman Khani Jazani

**üîµ About Me:**

I'm interested in natural language processing and representation learning in text and audio domains. One of my recent works are about building AI-based assistants to communicate with people in a natural way. My background in academia is in computer science and artificial intelligence from UT and AUT respectively. Since 2015, I have had many different experiences in industry which have been about AI (especially NLP) and data science from developer to management.

I want to talk about NLP and data science with my codes for different experience levels. I'm really interested in contributing to open-source projects which is useful for people. This GitHub page is updating...  

> In my free time, I'm working on [VoXera](https://github.com/VoXera) which is open-source language techs for Persian language. If you are interested, I look forward to working with you in [VoXera](https://github.com/VoXera). 


**üòç My Interests:**
- machine learning and deep learning
- natural language processing (text and speech)
- data science
